			<h2>Gaming</h2>
			<h3>Gaming is is a big part of who i am. I wouldn't be the same person if i didn't spend all my time on the weekends glued to my computer. I play mostly overwatch, team fortress 2, and fortnite. I am very much into pc gaming, and love to talk about computer parts and other pc games.</h3> 
			
			


			<h2>Coding</h2>
			<h3>Coding is something I have just started learning. I really like it and I feel it should be taught at school. I am currently learning how to create a website that doesnt't look crappy. As you can probably tell, it didn't go very well</h3>


			<h2>Listening to Music</h2>
			<h3>I like to isten to music while rocket jumping on TF2, or when im messing around in the practice range in overwatch. Whatever it is, i love listening to music. It helps pass the time when im stuck in a plane or car when on a trip, and its something to do when im bored but tired.</h3>
